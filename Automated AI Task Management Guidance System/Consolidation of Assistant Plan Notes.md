## Copilot Next Steps

Now that we have the Career Coach agent in a good place, let's focus on the Project Manager agent using Bolt.diy. Here are the steps to ensure the new code assistant can work with the existing setup:

1\. \*\*Project Setup\*\*:  
   \- Ensure the new agent follows the same structure as the existing agents.  
   \- Use the same base classes and orchestrator for consistency.

2\. \*\*Configuration\*\*:  
   \- Update the \`.env\` file to include any new configurations needed for the Project Manager agent.  
   \- Ensure the new agent's dependencies are added to \`requirements.txt\`.

3\. \*\*Integration\*\*:  
   \- Register the new agent with the orchestrator.  
   \- Ensure the new agent can communicate with existing agents if needed.

4\. \*\*Testing\*\*:  
   \- Write tests for the new agent similar to the existing tests.  
   \- Ensure the new agent's functionality is covered.

5\. \*\*Documentation\*\*:  
   \- Update the PRD and work tracking documents to include the new agent.  
   \- Document any new APIs or endpoints.

## ChatGPT AI Assistant Next Steps

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step plan that leverages AI coding assistants and modular, integrated workflows to build your Elevate AI application. This plan is designed to help you quickly create an MVP you can both use for yourself and evolve into a marketable product.

─────────────────────────────  
Overview & Vision

• The goal is to create a “focus and task consolidation” assistant that:  – Pulls tasks from services (e.g., Notion, Google Calendar, Amazon)  – Offers a conversational interface to capture ideas and update priorities in real time  – Displays a clean, actionable dashboard (with a potential mind map or matrix view)  – Reinforces your personal workflow: offloading distractions while keeping your core “why” in focus

• The application should eventually evolve from a personal productivity tool into a marketable SaaS product that helps others gain clarity and focus.

─────────────────────────────  
Architecture & Modular Breakdown

1. **Core Modules**

 A. **Data Integration Module**  
  • Develop Python scripts to integrate APIs from Notion, Google Calendar, and (if needed) Amazon.  
  • Normalize data formats and store consolidated tasks in a lightweight database (SQLite, JSON, or even back into Notion).

 B. **Conversational Interface Module**  
  • Build a chatbot-like interface that lets you (or later, users) talk through ideas.  
  • Use an AI agent coder tool to rapidly prototype this component.

 C. **Dashboard & Visualization Module**  
  • Create a dashboard (using Flask, Streamlit, or a similar lightweight framework) that shows your immediate priorities, a “focus” message, and optionally a visual mind map of tasks/ideas.  
  • Ensure the dashboard can be accessed on both PC and mobile.

 D. **Automation & Insight Engine**  
  • Develop logic that auto-generates insights and suggestions (e.g., “commitment mode,” “reassess priorities”) based on your input and task status.  
  • Allow manual overrides (editing suggestions) as needed.

─────────────────────────────  
Technical Roadmap & Tool Integration

1. **API Integration & Task Consolidation (MVP Step 1\)**  • Set up Notion and Google Calendar API integrations using Python.  
    • Tools/Resources:  
     – Use the Python requests library for Notion API calls.  
     – Use googleapiclient.discovery for Google Calendar.  • Store tasks in a centralized data store.  
2. **Developing the Conversational Interface (MVP Step 2\)**  • Prototype a chat interface that captures your inputs and logs them into the consolidated task database.  • Leverage AI agent coders for rapid prototyping:   – Consider Bolt.DIY with Sonnet 3.7 if you want an agent that can quickly iterate on natural language prompts and code generation.   – Alternatively, the cline extension or RooCode in VS Code can provide inline assistance and help modularize code—pick based on which feels more intuitive in your VS Code workflow.  • Integrate this module with your backend so that every chat input updates the task database in real time.  
3. **Building the Dashboard & Visualization (MVP Step 3\)**  • Use a lightweight framework like Flask or Streamlit to create a web-based dashboard that:   – Shows your current top priority (e.g., “Focus: Prepare the wire”).   – Optionally, displays additional views such as a matrix of tasks or a mind map for big-picture reassurance.  • Ensure responsive design so it’s accessible on your phone, tablet, and PC.  
4. **Automation, Feedback, and Refinement (MVP Step 4\)**  • Implement an insight engine that, upon data changes, auto-suggests actions (e.g., “We agreed this is the top priority. Ready for a deep-focus session?”).  
    • Allow for easy manual editing of AI-generated insights to maintain a trusted “team decision.”  • Use iterative testing and rapid prototyping—leverage AI agent coders (Bolt.DIY/Sonnet, cline, or RooCode) to continuously refine the logic.

Timeline & Milestones

1. **Week 1–2: Planning & API Setup**  
    – Document detailed requirements in Notion.  
    – Set up API integrations (Notion, Google Calendar) and test data retrieval.  
2. **Week 3–4: Conversational Interface & MVP Chat Module**  
    – Prototype the chat interface using your chosen AI agent coder tool (evaluate Bolt.DIY with Sonnet vs. cline/RooCode in VS Code).  
    – Integrate chat inputs with the task database.  
3. **Week 5–6: Dashboard Development**  
    – Build a basic web dashboard to display tasks and priorities.  
    – Implement a minimal mind map view (can be a future enhancement if time is short).  
4. **Week 7–8: Automation & Refinement**  
    – Develop the insight engine and automation logic.  
    – Test the full workflow, gather feedback, and iterate.  
5. **Week 9+: Beta Testing & Market Preparation**  
    – Begin using the tool in your daily workflow.  
    – Document user feedback, refine features, and prepare a pitch/roadmap for a market launch.

Tool & Environment Recommendations

• **AI Agent Coders:**  
 – Bolt.DIY with Sonnet 3.7: Ideal for rapid prototyping and generating code based on natural language.  
 – VS Code Extensions (cline, RooCode): Offer in-editor assistance and can be integrated into your GitHub workflow.

• **Development Environment:**  
 – Stick with VS Code (or combine with PyCharm for Python-heavy modules) on your PC.  
 – Use TeamViewer for remote access to your development environment from other devices.

• **Version Control & Deployment:**  
 – Leverage GitHub for version control, continuous integration, and collaboration.  
 – Once stable, consider containerizing your app for easier deployment (Docker, for example).

Next Steps & Market Considerations

1. **Prototype & Validate:**  
    – Build a barebones version that integrates task consolidation and a basic dashboard.  
    – Validate internally (your own workflow) and collect initial feedback.  
2. **Refine & Automate:**  
    – Use the AI insight engine to refine the core user experience (focus reminders, reassessment prompts).  
3. **Market Testing:**  
    – Develop a go-to-market strategy. Start with a landing page, a beta invite for early adopters, and gather testimonials.  
4. **Scalability & Monetization:**  
    – Once the core product is stable, consider additional features (collaboration, integration with more platforms) and evaluate subscription or one-time purchase models.
