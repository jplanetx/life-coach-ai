# Task Documentation

This directory contains documentation for individual work items (tasks) in the project. Each task is documented in a separate markdown file, following the naming convention `WORKITEM-XXX.md`, where `XXX` is the work item ID.

## Task Document Template

When creating a new task document, use the following template:

```markdown
# WORKITEM-XXX: [Title]

## Task Details

Component: [Component Name]

## Implementation Notes

[Notes on the implementation, design decisions, etc.]

## Testing Steps

[Steps to test the implementation]

## Verification Results

[Results of the verification process]
```

## Example Task Document

Here is an example of a task document:

```markdown
# WORKITEM-001: Implement Authentication Improvements

## Task Details

Component: Authentication

## Implementation Notes

The authentication system needs improvements to handle token refreshes more reliably. Currently, the system may fail when tokens expire during active operations.

Key areas to address:
- Implement proactive token refresh before expiration
- Add retry mechanism for failed requests due to token expiration
- Improve error handling for authentication failures
- Add logging for authentication events

## Testing Steps

1. Test normal authentication flow
   ```python
   python scripts/test_authentication.py
   ```

2. Test token refresh scenario
   ```python
   python scripts/test_auth_crypto.py --force-refresh
   ```

3. Test error handling with invalid credentials
   ```python
   python scripts/test_auth_simple.py --invalid-creds
   ```
