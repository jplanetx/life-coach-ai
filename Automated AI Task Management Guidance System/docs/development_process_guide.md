# Development Process Guide: From PRD to Launch

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup (1-2 days)
1. Create a new project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir life-coach-ai
   cd life-coach-ai
   ```

2. Copy the task management scripts and templates from this repository:
   - `/scripts/start_task.py`
   - `/scripts/finish_task.py`
   - `/scripts/verify_implementation.py`
   - `/docs/templates/prd_template.md`

3. Initialize the project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/core src/agents src/utils docs/tasks tests/agents tests/core
   ```

### 2. PRD Development (2-3 days)
1. Copy the PRD template to your project:
   ```bash
   cp docs/templates/prd_template.md docs/PRD.md
   ```

2. Fill out each section of the PRD:
   - Define your AI agents (e.g., Career Coach, Financial Advisor, Health Coach)
   - Specify their interactions and responsibilities
   - Set clear success criteria
   - Create a realistic timeline

3. Create initial work items in `docs/work_tracking.md`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Component (For each AI agent)

1. **Plan the Component** (1 day)
   - Review PRD requirements for the agent
   - Break down into smaller tasks
   - Add tasks to work tracking document

2. **Initialize Development** (1 hour)
   ```bash
   # Example for starting Career Coach agent development
   python scripts/start_task.py 001 CareerCoach
   ```
   This will:
   - Create task documentation
   - Set up tracking
   - Create a new branch

3. **Implementation** (Duration varies)
   - Follow the task document outline
   - Write code in `src/agents/[agent_name]`
   - Create tests in `tests/agents/[agent_name]`
   - Document progress in task document

4. **Verification** (0.5-1 day)
   ```bash
   # Complete the task with verification
   python scripts/finish_task.py 001 CareerCoach
   ```

### 2. Iterative Development Process

For each feature or component:

1. **Morning** (1-2 hours)
   - Review current task status
   - Plan day's objectives
   - Start new task if needed
   - Update task documentation

2. **Development** (4-6 hours)
   - Implement features
   - Write tests
   - Document changes
   - Commit regularly

3. **Evening** (1-2 hours)
   - Review day's progress
   - Complete tasks if ready
   - Update work tracking
   - Plan next day's tasks

### 3. Integration Phases

After completing individual components:

1. **Agent Integration** (2-3 days per integration)
   - Start integration task
   - Connect agents
   - Test interactions
   - Document communication patterns

2. **System Testing** (1 week)
   - Full system verification
   - Performance testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Bug fixing

## Practical Example: Career Coach Agent

1. **Start the task**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/start_task.py 001 CareerCoach
   ```

2. **Update the task document** in `docs/tasks/WORKITEM-001.md`:
   - Add implementation details
   - List test scenarios
   - Document API endpoints

3. **Create the component**:
   ```python
   # src/agents/career_coach/agent.py
   class CareerCoachAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           # Initialize agent
           pass

       def analyze_career_path(self):
           # Implement career analysis
           pass

       def provide_recommendations(self):
           # Implement recommendations
           pass
   ```

4. **Write tests**:
   ```python
   # tests/agents/test_career_coach.py
   def test_career_analysis():
       # Test implementation
       pass
   ```

5. **Complete the task**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/finish_task.py 001 CareerCoach
   ```

## Launch Preparation

### 1. Pre-launch Checklist (1 week)
- Complete all planned tasks
- Run full system tests
- Review documentation
- Perform security audit
- Test deployment process

### 2. Launch Steps (1-2 days)
- Deploy infrastructure
- Initialize AI agents
- Monitor system performance
- Gather initial feedback

### 3. Post-launch (Ongoing)
- Monitor agent performance
- Collect user feedback
- Plan improvements
- Start new development cycle

## Best Practices

### Task Management
- Keep tasks focused and manageable
- Document decisions and changes
- Update tracking regularly
- Use meaningful commit messages

### Development
- Follow code style guidelines
- Write tests for new features
- Document API changes
- Review security implications

### Integration
- Test agent interactions early
- Monitor performance metrics
- Document integration points
- Plan for scalability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Task Management**
   - Issue: Task not tracking correctly
   - Solution: Check work_tracking.md format

2. **Development**
   - Issue: Agent integration failing
   - Solution: Review communication protocols

3. **Testing**
   - Issue: Tests failing unexpectedly
   - Solution: Check test environment setup

## Next Steps

1. Copy this development process guide to your project
2. Fill out the PRD template
3. Create initial work items
4. Begin with the foundation phase
