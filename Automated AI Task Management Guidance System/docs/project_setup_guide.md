# Project Setup Guide for Task Management Process

This guide outlines how to set up a new project with the task management process we've implemented.

## Initial Project Setup

1. Create your project folder and initialize it:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_new_project
   cd my_new_project
   git init
   ```

2. Create the basic directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/core src/utils docs/tasks scripts tests/test_core tests/test_utils
   ```

3. Copy the task management scripts from this project:
   - `scripts/start_task.py`
   - `scripts/finish_task.py`
   - `scripts/verify_implementation.py`

4. Create the initial documentation files:
   - `docs/work_tracking.md`
   - `docs/tasks/README.md`

## Creating an Initial Project Plan

Yes, starting with a plan is highly recommended. While there's no strict template requirement, a good project plan should include:

### Project Plan Template

```markdown
# Project Plan: [Project Name]

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project, its goals, and purpose]

## Architecture
[High-level description of the system architecture]

## Components
[List of major components/modules and their responsibilities]

## Work Items
[Initial list of work items to be completed]

### WORKITEM-001: [Title]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Description: [Brief description]

### WORKITEM-002: [Title]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Description: [Brief description]

## Development Process
[Description of the development process, including branching strategy, code review process, etc.]

## Timeline
[Estimated timeline for completing the project]
```

## Implementing the Task Management Process

1. Create the initial work tracking document (`docs/work_tracking.md`):

```markdown
# Work Tracking

This document serves as the central tracking system for all work items in the project. It provides a clear overview of what tasks are pending, in progress, and completed.

## Active Work Items

### WORKITEM-001: [Title]
Status: Pending
Component: [Component Name]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Description: [Brief description of the task]

### WORKITEM-002: [Title]
Status: Pending
Component: [Component Name]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Description: [Brief description of the task]

## Completed Work Items

No completed work items yet.

## Work Item Template

When adding a new work item, use the following template:

```
### WORKITEM-XXX: [Title]
Status: [Pending/In Progress/Complete]
Component: [Component Name]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Description: [Brief description of the task]
```

## Process Guidelines

1. When starting work on an item, update its status to "In Progress"
2. Create a task document in `docs/tasks/WORKITEM-XXX.md`
3. Use the `start_task.py` script to set up the environment
4. When completed, use the `finish_task.py` script to update tracking
```

2. Create the tasks README (`docs/tasks/README.md`) as we did in this project.

3. Implement a basic verification script (`scripts/verify_implementation.py`) that you can customize for your project's components.

## Using the Task Management Process

1. Start a new task:
   ```bash
   python scripts/start_task.py 001 ComponentName
   ```

2. This will:
   - Create a new git branch for the task
   - Create a task document in `docs/tasks/`
   - Update the work tracking document

3. Implement the task according to the requirements in the task document.

4. Complete the task:
   ```bash
   python scripts/finish_task.py 001 ComponentName
   ```

5. This will:
   - Run verification tests for the component
   - Update the task document with verification results
   - Update the work tracking document to mark the task as complete

6. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "WORKITEM-001: Complete ComponentName implementation"
   ```

## Customizing for Your Project

The task management process can be customized to fit your project's specific needs:

1. Modify the verification script to include tests specific to your project's components.
2. Adjust the task document template to include additional sections relevant to your project.
3. Extend the work tracking document to include additional information about tasks.

## Best Practices

1. Always start with a clear project plan that outlines the major components and work items.
2. Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves.
3. Use the task management scripts consistently to maintain a clear record of work.
4. Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages.
5. Review completed tasks to ensure they meet the requirements before marking them as complete.
